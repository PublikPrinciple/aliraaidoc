## What is Instructional Support?

The Instructional Support domain measures how effectively you facilitate learning, promote thinking, and provide high-quality instructional interactions.

## Key Components

### Concept Development
- **Analysis and reasoning**: Encouraging higher-order thinking
- **Creating**: Supporting student creativity and innovation
- **Integration**: Connecting learning across subjects and experiences
- **Connections to real world**: Making learning relevant and meaningful

### Quality of Feedback
- **Scaffolding**: Providing appropriate support for learning
- **Back-and-forth exchanges**: Engaging in meaningful dialogue
- **Encouragement and affirmation**: Supporting student confidence
- **Specific feedback**: Giving clear, actionable guidance

### Language Modeling
- **Frequent conversation**: Engaging students in discussion
- **Open-ended questions**: Promoting thinking and reasoning
- **Repetition and extension**: Building on student responses
- **Advanced language**: Introducing sophisticated vocabulary

## Typical Scenarios

### Example Situations
- Facilitating student discussions and questions
- Providing feedback on student work
- Supporting struggling learners with scaffolding
- Encouraging creative problem-solving
- Making abstract concepts concrete

### Assessment Focus
- Your questioning and facilitation techniques
- How you provide feedback and support
- Strategies for promoting higher-order thinking
- Methods for making learning meaningful

## What Assessors Look For

### Strong Responses Include
- **Open-ended questioning strategies**
- **Specific examples of scaffolding techniques**
- **Evidence of promoting student thinking**
- **Connections between concepts and real-world applications**

### Growth Areas Often Include
- **Balancing support with challenge**
- **Moving beyond recall to analysis**
- **Providing timely, specific feedback**
- **Facilitating peer-to-peer learning**

## Development Strategies

### Building Skills
- Practice using Bloom's Taxonomy in questioning
- Develop repertoire of scaffolding techniques
- Study effective feedback practices
- Learn about inquiry-based learning methods

### Reflection Questions
- How do I encourage students to think deeply about content?
- What types of questions do I ask most frequently?
- How do I provide feedback that moves learning forward?
- In what ways do I connect learning to students' lives?

## Instructional Techniques

### Questioning Strategies
- **Open-ended questions**: "What do you think would happen if...?"
- **Follow-up probes**: "Can you tell me more about that?"
- **Comparison questions**: "How is this similar to...?"
- **Analysis prompts**: "Why do you think that happened?"

### Scaffolding Methods
- **Modeling**: Demonstrating thinking processes
- **Guided practice**: Working through problems together
- **Visual supports**: Using graphic organizers and charts
- **Peer collaboration**: Structured partner work

### Feedback Practices
- **Specific and actionable**: Clear next steps for improvement
- **Timely**: Given when most useful for learning
- **Growth-oriented**: Focused on progress and effort
- **Student-involved**: Encouraging self-assessment
