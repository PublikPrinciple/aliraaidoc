## How AliraAI Works

### 1. Voice-Based Scenarios ðŸŽ¤

#### Natural Conversation Format
Teachers respond to realistic classroom situations using their voice, creating an authentic dialogue about their teaching practice.

**Example Interaction:**
> **AliraAI**: "A student in your class has been withdrawn and seems upset lately. How would you approach this situation?"
> 
> **Teacher Response**: "When I notice a student is withdrawn, I start by creating small opportunities for connection. For example, I might greet them personally at the door or find a moment to check in privately. I once had a student who was struggling with family issues, and I worked with our counselor to provide consistent support while maintaining their dignity in the classroom..."
